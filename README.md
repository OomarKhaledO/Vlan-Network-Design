# VLAN Network Design using Cisco Packet Tracer

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a VLAN-based network
using Cisco Packet Tracer.

## Project Overview
- Multiple VLANs configured across different locations
- Inter-VLAN communication (if implemented)
- Proper switch port assignment
- Network segmentation for security and performance

## Tools Used
- Cisco Packet Tracer

## Key Concepts Applied
- VLAN creation and configuration
- Access and trunk ports
- Switch-to-switch communication
- Network segmentation

## How to Open
1. Download the `.pkt` file
2. Open it using Cisco Packet Tracer

## Notes
This project was created as part of a networking course.
Possible improvements include routing between VLANs and adding security policies.
